#ComeyHearings painted a profoundly disturbing portrait of @realDonaldTrump and his administration.
@realDonaldTrump MAJOR red flag: Comey felt compelled to take detailed notes with @realDonaldTrump because he was concerned Trump wouldn't tell the truth.

"There's no question @POTUS businesses are causing serious conflicts of interest, and pose extraordinary risks of corruption. Let me explain:"
".@POTUS made Mar-A-Lago his ""Winter White House."" It’s not. It’s a private for-profit business where dues just increased from $100k to $200k"
"Guests at Mar-A-Lago brag about being close to action, post photos of guy with nuclear codes. It is quite literally $$$ for access to @POTUS"
.@POTUS says he paid for hosting Shinzo Abe at the Mar-A-Lago. Maybe. But undoubtedly far less than he’s profiting from the increased dues.
"Because @POTUS is a walking, talking violation of the Emoluments Clause, profound questions arise that the Clause was meant to avoid, like:"
"Did China finally grant trademarks to Trump family after ten years, because @POTUS agreed to the ""One China"" policy?"

.@POTUS used many myths today to justify his withdrawal from the #ParisAgreement. Here are 3 we can debunk right off the bat.
"@POTUS Trump Myth #1: #ParisAgreement would effectively decapitate our coal industry, which now supplies about one-third of our electric power."
"With his decision to withdraw from #ParisAgreement, POTUS is undermining our security &amp; once again breaking his promise to keep America safe https://t.co/KP4BBkgeir"
"@POTUS Fact: Low natural gas prices are threatening the coal industry, not the #ParisAgreement. @EIAgov https://t.co/hozOHbrxOe"
"@POTUS @EIAgov Trump Myth #2: “The current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America, which it does.” - @POTUS"
@POTUS @EIAgov Fact: The United States can use clean coal technology to meet its #ParisAgreement target. https://t.co/A87Gs8tcV5
"@POTUS @EIAgov Trump Myth #3: Losses would be $3 trillion GDP &amp; 6.5 million industrial jobs &amp; households would have $7,000 less income, in some cases more."

"According to Comey, POTUS was not under investigation, never sought to impend any Russian investigation, and Russia did not effect election."

"The @GOP is selling #FakeNews. If you listen to my question, I only asked about officials at Justice, not @POTUS. Don't fall for their lies https://t.co/cxkKNOeeni"
The takeaway from #ComeyHearings today –&gt; former FBI Director established a foundation for obstruction of justice charge against @POTUS 1/
@POTUS Obstruction of justice does NOT require proof that justice was obstructed — only that a person endeavored to influence or impede justice 2/
"@POTUS In other words, a President trying to derail, influence, chill, direct a federal investigation … that’s obstruction of justice. 3/"
"@POTUS We already knew Trump told then FBI Director James Comey: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” 4/ https://t.co/F04ygjwt6P"
"@POTUS Now, Comey testified that he took Trump’s actions to be “direction” to the FBI Director to drop the investigation into Flynn 👇🏽 5/ https://t.co/omj0OgNRBB"
@POTUS A reminder that it’s not just Flynn- other Trump associates are reported to have undisclosed communications w/ Russian officials. 6/
"@POTUS Under oath, Sessions failed to divulge meeting with the Russian ambassador, which led to his recusal from the Russia investigation 7/"
@POTUS It’s also been reported Kushner is under FBI scrutiny re: Russia investigation &amp; that he pushed for Comey’s firing. 8/
@POTUS Comey testified multiple times today that he believes Trump fired him to relieve pressure on the Russian investigation 👇🏽 9/ https://t.co/TzVsVvAPyM
@POTUS So do not let anyone minimize the importance of Comey’s testimony. It is profoundly consequential. 11/

It's baffling that @POTUS doesn't have a specific agenda for the Putin meeting. Here are the first few things that come to my mind:
@POTUS Putin's interference in our elections last yr. Attack on our democracy. House needs to pass Senate sanctions bill. https://t.co/8zY6Y994oZ
@POTUS Putin's interference in the elections of our European allies &amp; partners. We stand with our friends in Europe.
@POTUS Putin's occupation and annexation of Crimea.
@POTUS Putin's support to Russian-led separatists in the Donbas &amp; failure to comply w Minsk Agreemts. We stand w/ our Ukrainian brothers &amp; sisters.
"@POTUS In Syria, Putin's support to and cooperation with Assad regime, Iran, and Hezbollah. We stand with the Syrian people."
@POTUS Putin's suppression of political dissent in Russia.
@POTUS Putin's energy manipulation and coercion of our European partners and allies.
@POTUS Putin and his oligarch's corruption and fleecing of Russia and its people.
@MemoryBrain_UW @NIH .@POTUS' shortsighted budget cuts @NIH by $7B. We need to invest in research to accelerate development of life-saving treatments &amp; cures.

".@POTUS delivered a strong, visionary, unifying and optimistic speech. I look forward to working with him this year on the many items he outlined tonight. #SOTU https://t.co/nqOCMpP57P"
"@POTUS 1) The agenda is working. As a result of historic tax cuts &amp; regulatory relief, companies are creating new jobs, pumping money into the economy, &amp; investing in America. PLUS, 3M+ Americans are receiving a bonus or wage increase. This is the beginning of a real turnaround."
"2) @POTUS campaigned &amp; won on fixing our immigration system, &amp; he is showing real leadership to get it done."
"From improving our aging infrastructure to enhancing our national security, tonight @POTUS outlined his priorities that put #NV - and America – first. I look forward to continue working w/this Administration &amp; I’m optimistic about what can be accomplished. https://t.co/Ki2OwPmaUB"
4) Free trade is critical but it must also be fair. @POTUS made it clear he wants a level playing field for American workers &amp; businesses.
"5) For the first time in 8 years, we have started to reinvest in our military, but we must do more. @POTUS is committed to peace through strength &amp; is reengaging with the rest of the world."

The American people deserve to know why Rob Porter continued to be employed by @WhiteHouse despite his inability to gain security clearance allegedly because of his domestic violence. Glad @TGowdySC will investigate this serious situation. https://t.co/PPDbtufTDR
We're continuing to work on the Securing America's Future Act here in the House. Encouraged by support of @POTUS &amp; many House members. https://t.co/U4L5piRIPz
It’s been 2 weeks since #POTUS defied Congress by not placing new sanctions on Russia. This is required by a law that Congress passed last summer by a 98-2 vote in the Senate and a 419-3 vote in the House. https://t.co/8zduxEsUPg
It’s unconscionable that #POTUS continues to drag his feet &amp; it begs the question: how far will he go to protect #Putin?
I welcome the @POTUS' #infrastructure proposal with optimism. Our country faces many challenges and this blueprint sets us on a path to address them. An efficient transportation network is vital to our economic future and we must seize on the enthusiasm to get this done. https://t.co/ovDqN8B4dn
"In the past year, I was pleased that @POTUS signed my bill to authorize @ncfihoover, and that the Obama admin's actions to restrict the 1033 Program were reversed. #mcsa18 #leadingtheway https://t.co/ZrKnZjawIe"
"Today I'm sending a message of support and solidarity #ToImmigrantsWithLove. We’ve opposed @POTUS' #MuslimBan on the Supreme Court steps, protested hate speech and fought to #ProtectDreamers, and we’ll keep working hard to preserve everyone’s right to achieve the American Dream. https://t.co/fZGnRmv0SP"

RT @FLGovScott: Just spoke with @POTUS about shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. My thoughts and prayers are with the student…
".@POTUS's patchwork proposal is insufficient, at best, to fix America's crumbling infrastructure. A dedicated, permanent funding stream to repair, rebuild, and modernize the bones of our great nation is needed. My new op-ed in @thehill ➔ https://t.co/5AO5HH61JP"
"In addition to higher wages and lower taxes, @POTUS' tax cut plan is also delivering relief from Obamacare. Read my op-ed in the @DailyCaller: https://t.co/qulwh1TnEi"
"Wisconsin is concerned with President Trump’s proposed 90% cut to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Investments in the #GreatLakes are an investment in our economy. Rather than supporting progress, @POTUS budget would stall our #GLRI effort. https://t.co/L32c3IPaag"
@POTUS Instead of cutting funding for our #GreatLakes how about cutting off EPA Administrator Pruitt's frequent 1st class flights at taxpayer expense. https://t.co/hm2wMzSAzN
"""The move also allows for streamlined, cohesive leadership, providing swift responses to #publichealth emergencies."" Read more about the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), what it is &amp; how @POTUS' budget proposal impacts the SNS &gt;&gt; https://t.co/3LglY7Pyvt"
"RT @WhiteHouse: ""The Administration strongly opposes passage of the Schumer-Rounds-Collins Amendment."" Statement from @PressSec regarding t…"
.@POTUS’s refusal to mention guns in his statement on horrific #Parkland shooting is height of cowardice &amp; worthy of strong bipartisan condemnation. POTUS and Rs need to join Dems in strengthening our nation’s gun laws. Bloviating on TV doesn’t cut it. https://t.co/4Gtc41GK25
"As I’ve said before – @POTUS has been very clear about what he will sign into law, and the Secure &amp; Succeed Act is it. https://t.co/vMCzvV5EMr"
"I voted for Coons-McCain, a bipartisan bill to #ProtectDreamers without wasting billions on an offensive wall. @RealDonaldTrump created this crisis for DREAMers. Now @POTUS and Republican leaders are doing everything to stop us from fixing it."
Margaret Weichert is a seasoned professional who will provide excellent leadership at the @WhiteHouse Office of Management and Budget. Congratulations to this fine Georgian on her Senate confirmation last evening.
RT @FoxNews: .@POTUS addresses the nation on the deadly Florida school shooting. https://t.co/9ZlHad0I5M
I voted no on wasting $25B on an offensive wall on our border. I stand with NM families who oppose @POTUS' effort to impose his xenophobic agenda on our state. New Mexicans of all political backgrounds overwhelmingly support DREAMers and oppose a wall in our backyard.
"If the ""meals"" delivered to storm-ravaged #PuertoRico and #USVI are any indication, one can surmise that @POTUS' ""Blue Apron-style"" program for SNAP recipients will be thin gruel. With no plans to include fresh produce or meat, this thoughtless plan should be DOA. https://t.co/yGM1u00sZE"
"New op-ed in @thehill - Here’s what’s wrong with Trump’s plan for U.S. infrastructure 📰 - I make the case for a dedicated, permanent funding stream to repair, rebuild, &amp; modernize our infrastructure. @POTUS's patchwork proposal is insufficient at best. https://t.co/5AO5HH61JP"
"At every turn, @POTUS undermined our efforts to solve the crisis that he created. Today’s resounding bipartisan rejection of the President’s proposal should lead him to reconsider his extreme position. My full statement: https://t.co/hurm1EcXJC"
"POTUS promised to deport violent criminals, not innocent young people who are working, going to school, paying taxes &amp; contributing to their communities. Dreamers were brought here as children, thru no fault of their own, &amp; they are American in every sense but the paperwork. -SB"
"I am bitterly disappointed by today's failure to pass legislation protecting #Dreamers. By threatening to veto bipartisan legislation, @POTUS – once again – poisoned good-faith bipartisan negotiations and made it impossible to find a viable compromise. But this fight is not over."
"It’s clear the only path forward to providing a permanent solution for #DACA, securing our borders &amp; modernizing our immigration system is building consensus on a plan @POTUS supports &amp; can be signed into law. I’ll continue to work on both sides of the aisle to reach consensus."
"Amidst one of the deadliest flu seasons in recent years should we: allow the Centers for Disease Control @CDCgov to give 1.9 million adult flu shots + 420,000 pediatric measles vaccinations OR foot the bill for .@POTUS's $30 million parade? https://t.co/Csvz2tb3QF"
"Following today’s votes in the Senate, it is clear @POTUS’ vision for immigration policy cannot move forward. I hope he will demonstrate real leadership &amp; work with Congress to find a bipartisan compromise to fix this problem he created &amp; #ProtectDREAMers. https://t.co/R6TKL79iAr"
We received a crystal clear message from the intelligence chiefs that testified before Congress: Russia interfered in the 2016 election &amp; is already using digital means to do it again. The @NYTimes explores why @POTUS refuses “to even acknowledge the malevolent Russia role.” https://t.co/UkDSucvfN3
"Good morning, #IN05! This week, @POTUS signed a #bipartisan bill into law that works to protect our nation's young athletes. In the House, I led its companion bill w/@RepLoisFrankel. Read more about the bill, now law, in the @NoblesvilleIN Times &gt;&gt; https://t.co/CpKSMPUucw"
