3,5,today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces . thankavet https : t . co wpk7qwpk8zbusy day planned in new york . will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government ! love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country . we will all come together and be proud ! just had a very open and successful presidential election . now professional protesters incited by the media are protesting . very unfair ! a fantastic day in d . c . met with president obama for first time . really good meeting great chemistry . melania liked mrs . o a lot !
4,1,this will prove to be a great time in the lives of all americans . we will unite and we will win win win !
5,8,the debates especially the second and third plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies plus our great supporters gave us the win ! i will be interviewed on 60minutes tonight after the nfl game 7 : 00 p . m . enjoy ! the nytimes states today that djt believes more countries should acquire nuclear weapons . how dishonest are they . i never said this ! governor john kasich of the great great great state of ohio called to congratulate me on the win . the people of ohio were incredible ! jeb bush george w and george h . w . all called to express their best wishes on the win . very nice ! mitt romney called to congratulate me on the win . very nice ! the nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their bad coverage of me . i wonder if it will change doubt it ? wow the nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the trump phenomena
7,2,the electoral college is actually genius in that it brings all states including the smaller ones into play . campaigning is much different ! if the election were based on total popular vote i would have campaigned in n . y . florida and california and won even bigger and more easily
8,5,australia new zealand and more . i am always available to them . nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me . i have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing nytimes said . russia u . k . china saudi arabia japanthe failing nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition . it is going so smoothly . also i have spoken to many foreign leaders . i am not trying to get top level security clearance for my children . this was a typically false news story . very organized process taking place as i decide on cabinet and many other positions . i am the only one who knows who the finalists are !
9,1,my transition team which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job will be seeing many great candidates today . maga

11,4,the theater must always be a safe and special place . the cast of hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man mike pence . apologize ! our wonderful future v . p . mike pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of hamilton cameras blazing . this should not happen ! the only bad thing about winning the presidency is that i did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on trump u . too bad ! i settled the trump university lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as president i have to focus on our country .
12,5,i have always had a good relationship with chuck schumer . he is far smarter than harry r and has the ability to get things done . good news ! general james mad dog mattis who is being considered for secretary of defense was very impressive yesterday . a true general 's general ! i watched parts of nbcsnl saturday night live last night . it is a totally one sided biased show nothing funny at all . equal time for us ? numerous patriots will be coming to bedminster today as i continue to fill out the various positions necessary to make america great again ! the cast and producers of hamilton which i hear is highly overrated should immediately apologize to mike pence for their terrible behavior

15,1,bus crash in tennessee so sad amp ; so terrible . condolences to all family members and loved ones . these beautiful children will be remembered !

18,1,fidel castro is dead !
19,12,states instead of the 15 states that i visited . i would have won even more easily and convincingly but smaller states are forgotten ! it would have been much easier for me to win the so called popular vote than the electoral college in that i would only campaign in 3 or 4 in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegallytrump is going to be our president . we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead . so much time and money will be spent same result ! sadthis election . that is a direct threat to our democracy . she then said we have to accept the results and look to the future donald of position . then separately she stated he said something truly horrifying . . . he refused to say that he would respect the results of during a general election . i for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind and fair elections . we've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a hillary 's debate answer on delay : that is horrifying . that is not the way our democracy works . been around for 240 years . we've had free hillary clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in . nothing will changethe democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted . not so anymore ! the green party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated amp ; demoralized dems
20,3,just met with general petraeus was very impressed ! if cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the cuban people the cuban american people and the u . s . as a whole i will terminate deal . serious voter fraud in virginia new hampshire and california so why isn't the media reporting on this ? serious bias big problem !
